    title: 'Frankfurt Motor Show 2017: preview',
    description: `We round up the exciting new cars that we'll be seeing for the first time at the 2017 Frankfurt Motor Show in September
Every year the Frankfurt Motor Show re-ignites a busy season of international new car events as, if you exclude the Goodwood Festival of Speed, it's the first major international motor show since Geneva in March. 
The doors of the 67th IAA International Motor Show open to the press on the 12th September and the public on the 14th, but the Frankfurt build-up has already begun, with several manufacturers announcing new models that are destined for the show stands. We'll have important debuts from brands such as Audi, BMW, Jaguar, Renault and Volkswagen, plus some surprise appearances too. 
However, a number of big carmakers have elected not to attend the Frankfurt Motor Show this year. FCA (including Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Jeep) are reportedly not showing anything, along with Peugeot and Nissan, which will be unveiling its new Leaf electric car in a separate event that month. Frankfurt is traditionally dominated by the domestic German manufacturers with their huge stands and high profile debuts so it may be that other manufacturers are worried about getting their share of the Frankfurt limelight. 
What we do know for certain is that there'll be a glittering array of new metal at the event. We'll be regularly updating this page on the lead up to and during the 2017 Frankfurt Motor Show press days. Be sure to check here for the latest news, images and videos from one of the world's largest new car events.

    title: 'BMW issues statement denying Euro 6 diesel emissions collusion with VW and Mercedes',
    description: `BMW's statement comes after allegations last week of an agreement between VW, Mercedes and BMW to fit smaller AdBlue tanks
BMW has commented on recent reports of a suspected antitrust pact between itself, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz, relating to exhaust gas emissions on diesel vehicles and collusion over the AdBlue tanks these cars are fitted with to purify diesel emissions.
In the statement, the firm says: “BMW vehicles are not manipulated and comply with respective legal requirements”, adding, “The BMW Group categorically rejects accusations that Euro 6 vehicles sold by the company do not provide adequate exhaust gas treatment due to AdBlue tanks that are too small.”
The firm says that its Euro 6 cars employ a NOx-storage catalytic converter alongside AdBlue injection, which means that it can reduce emissions using less AdBlue. Thus, the size of the AdBlue tank is dictated by requirements, and not by an agreement between manufacturers.
BMW currently sees no reason to issue a voluntary recall for diesel cars fitted with Euro 6 compliant engines, but the firm has committed to an optional software upgrade for Euro 5 diesel cars at no cost to customers.
Last week, German newspaper Spiegel cited documents submitted by VW and another by Daimler, purportedly revealing that Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW are being investigated by Germany’s Federal Cartel Office on suspected antitrust collusion over decades on technology relating to exhaust gas measures on diesel vehicles. 
The companies allegedly met to discuss AdBlue tanks, which deliver the urea that purifies diesel emissions in many of the brand's cars. It goes on to say that the companies decided to avoid expensive larger tanks and instead fit smaller ones that aren't able to clean exhaust gases sufficiently.
Convertible roofs and part suppliers were apparently also discussed by the German manufacturers. Germany’s Federal Cartel Office is investigating the matter, and previously looked at six companies last year regarding collusion on steel prices.

    title: 'Bentley reveals new Continental GT Convertible Galene Edition',
    description: `New limited edition Bentley Continental GT Convertible is supposedly inspired by superyachts
Bentley has revealed another special edition Continental GT by its bespoke modifications arm Mulliner, which is a limited edition convertible inspired by luxury yachts.
Called the Continental GT Convertible Galene Edition by Mulliner, just 30 examples will be produced.
Bentley has sought the assistance of experts Princess Yachts to spec the Galene Edition Continental GTs. The car is defined by its bright white paint with bright blue contrasting highlights, while it rides on huge 21-inch polished ‘Propeller’ style wheels. The convertible hood is finished in dark blue too, imitating the canopies used on many yachts.
The yacht-inspired look continues in the cabin, with a selection of materials and trim finishes inspired by the seas. A full cabin upholstery finished with Linen and Portland mimics the seating found on many superyachts, while cars can be specified with unique, hand-painted Jaume Viladell illustrations of yachts on the dashboard fascia. The same Glacier White paint shade used on the car’s exterior is dotted around the cabin too.
Finally, Mulliner has created a new material specially for the Galene Edition. Called Pinstripe Walnut, it’s used in open-pore form and is found on both the centre stack and console. Pinstripe Walnut is also used as an insert on the treadplates, while it also lines the boot floor.
What do you make of the Continental GT Convertible Galene Edition? Let us know in the comments.
